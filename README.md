This project involves downloading and merging at least five different datasets from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Using Python and the Bokeh library, the work focuses on creating interactive data visualizations that explore complex health relationships. The analysis emphasizes advanced data wrangling techniques, including data filtering, aggregation, and handling missing values. The project aims to generate insightful conclusions while critically addressing potential data privacy and ethical considerations
